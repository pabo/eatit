Welcome to Eat it!
==================
This is a proof-of-concept project with some tongue-in-cheek styling, developed as a code sample for gofundme.com. It consists of a simple php json service and an HTML/javascript/jQuery front-end. To get started, open up index.html and begin typing a query into the search box. As you type, it will fetch results from the json service, and create the autocompleter you can interact with. Use either the mouse or the arrow up/down and enter keys to choose a selection. (Nothing actually happens when you choose)


Files
=====
scripts/ajaxget.js
fetch results and insert them into the HTML page, for simple display or to hook up an autocompleter to.

scripts/autocomplete.js
auto completer. user interacts with it with various key/mouse events.

scripts/elementCycle.js
just a little fun: I use it here to cycle through random appropriate lyrics from the Weird Al song "Eat it".

scripts/script.js

Specification
=============
project guidelines: (from http://www.gofundme.com/code-sample)

Using the information above code us a page that:
-Has a place for a user to type
-As the user is typing, a list of restaurant names should be shown to them. The results should include any restaurant whose name starts with the letters the user has typed so far AND any restaurant whose cuisine starts with the letters typed so far.
-This page needs to be fast, look good and function properly.
-This needs to be coded in PHP and jQuery
