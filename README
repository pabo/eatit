Welcome to Eat it!
==================
This is a proof-of-concept project with some tongue-in-cheek styling, developed as a code sample for gofundme.com. It consists of a simple php json service and an HTML/javascript/jQuery front-end. As you type a query into the search box, it fetches results from the json service, and creates the autocompleter you can interact with.


Files
=====
scripts/ajaxget.js
fetch results and insert them into the HTML page, for simple display or to hook up an autocompleter to.

scripts/autocomplete.js
auto completer. user interacts with it with various key/mouse events.

scripts/elementCycle.js
just a little fun: I use it here to cycle through random appropriate lyrics from the Weird Al song "Eat it".

scripts/script.js


cgi/q.php
json service which responds to a query with a list of results

db.csv
csv file of restaurants, referenced by cgi/q.php

Specification
=============
project guidelines: (from http://www.gofundme.com/code-sample)

Using the information above code us a page that:
-Has a place for a user to type
-As the user is typing, a list of restaurant names should be shown to them. The results should include any restaurant whose name starts with the letters the user has typed so far AND any restaurant whose cuisine starts with the letters typed so far.
